    "Here, the engine score is given in 'Centipawns.' Modify the code below to match your own system and to confirm you have the engine set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you may notice that the scores returned by the engine are not consistent. That is, the same position may return a slightly different score. However, because the difference is small, it should not be an issue as the general trends hold true and the puzzles here tend to have an unambiguous best answer. As a failsafe, if your implementation returns the move we're looking for, you'll get full credit regardless of whatever score the engine returns."
